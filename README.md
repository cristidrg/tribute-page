# tribute-page
A tribute page for the legendary footballer Gheorghe Hagi made as a front-end project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). I made it using only [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/HTML/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3).


The purpose of this project was to learn how to position elements in a web-page and how to master the CSS FlexBox technique.
